                "After having been domesticated for so long, it's impossible in some cases to return a pokémon to the wild.
                In most scenarios we've seen, the Pokémon will have a lot of difficulty readjusting to life in the wilderness and often end up suffering on their own.
                Here at I.C.Y., it's our honor and privilage to help these wonderful creatures find new homes and loving families."

    Since opening back in 2014, it's been our mission to help as many pokémon in need as we can. 
    It's thanks to our wonderful community that we're able to continue our work to this day, and we are still eternally grateful. <3
